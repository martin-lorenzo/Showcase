The current version of the Bridge Game includes:

Fully functional game logic, designed with pure JavaScript.
An interactive user interface that enhances player engagement.

A lives counter to keep track of your progress.

Some of the planned features include:

Animation: I aim to introduce animations to enhance the game's look and feel, and to make the gameplay more engaging.

Progress to different stages: In the future, Im looking to add multiple stages of increasing difficulty to challenge our players even further.
